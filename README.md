# Login Forensics: Cybersecurity Audit & Log Analysis with Alteryx

This project simulates a real-world SOC 2 cybersecurity audit engagement for a fictional SaaS company. Conducted using Alteryx Designer, the case focused on identifying internal control weaknesses, analyzing system authentication logs, and evaluating data integrity risks through log-based forensics.

## Project Overview

- **Date**: April 2025  
- **Institution**: Pepperdine University  
- **Course**: Cost Analysis & Systems (AC 314)  
- **Academic Partner**: Ernst & Young Foundationâ€™s Academic Resource Center  

As part of a case-based learning experience, the project introduced real-world expectations for audit readiness, cybersecurity, and control testing using data analytics.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze thousands of authentication logs to identify anomalies and internal control lapses
- Investigate inactive accounts, unauthorized access, and login attempts post-termination
- Detect missing log entries and propose plausible explanations for data deletion
- Provide professional judgment and control recommendations aligned with ITGC and audit standards

## Key Tasks Completed

- Built multiple Alteryx workflows to extract, transform, and analyze log files and employee metadata
- Joined disparate tables to track login behavior across employee status, termination dates, and work calendars
- Flagged:
  - Logins from deactivated accounts
  - Activity on holidays and weekends
  - Unusual patterns indicating insider threat potential
- Drafted audit-style memos summarizing findings and suggesting remediating controls

## Tools and Skills

- Alteryx Designer
  - Workflow automation
  - Multi-source data joins
  - Conditional logic and filtering
- Internal control evaluation (SOC 2/ITGC context)
- Data storytelling through audit memos
- Team-based problem-solving and time-sensitive analysis
